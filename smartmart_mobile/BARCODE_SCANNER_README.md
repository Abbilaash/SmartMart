# SmartMart Mobile App - Barcode Scanner Updates

## Overview

The barcode scanner has been updated to:

1. Display only the scanned barcode (not product details)
2. Integrate with the backend API to add products to cart
3. Remove quantity controls from cart items

## Changes Made

### 1. Barcode Scanner Screen (`barcode_scanner_screen.dart`)

- **Before**: Showed product name, price, and details after scanning
- **After**: Shows only the scanned barcode in a styled container
- **Integration**: Now calls the cart API when "Add to Cart" is pressed

### 2. Product API Service (`product_api_service.dart`)

- New service to fetch product details by barcode from backend
- Falls back to mock product creation if API is not available
- Uses the barcode as product_id for cart operations

### 3. Cart Item Widget (`cart_item_widget.dart`)

- **Removed**: Add/Subtract quantity buttons
- **Added**: Static quantity display with styled container
- **Kept**: Delete button for removing items from cart

### 4. API Configuration (`api_config.dart`)

- Added product endpoint configuration
- Centralized API settings

## How It Works Now

### Scanning Process:

1. User scans a barcode/QR code
2. App displays only the scanned barcode value
3. User clicks "Add to Cart"
4. App calls backend API: `POST /users/carts/add_product`
5. Backend validates product and adds to cart
6. User is redirected back to home screen

### Cart Display:

- Shows product details fetched from backend
- Displays quantity as read-only information
- Remove button deletes items via API
- No quantity modification controls

## API Endpoints Used

- **GET** `/products/{barcode}` - Fetch product by barcode (if available)
- **POST** `/users/carts/add_product` - Add product to cart
- **POST** `/users/carts/get_products` - Fetch cart contents
- **POST** `/users/carts/delete_product` - Remove product from cart

## Testing

1. **Scan a barcode** - Should display only the barcode value
2. **Click "Add to Cart"** - Should call backend API
3. **Check cart** - Should show product details from backend
4. **Remove items** - Should update backend and refresh cart

## Backend Requirements

The backend should have:

- Products collection with `product_id` field matching barcodes
- Cart management endpoints working correctly
- Proper error handling for missing products

## Future Improvements

- Real-time barcode validation
- Product search by barcode
- Better error messages for invalid barcodes
- Offline barcode caching
